Welcome to this guided project about creating a voice assistant using OpenAI and IBM Watson Speech Libraries for Embed. 

The guided project takes you through building a virtual assistant that can take voice input, convert it to text using speech-to-text technology, send the text to OpenAI's GPT-3 model, receive a response, convert it to speech using text-to-speech technology and finally play it back to the user. 

The voice assistant will have a responsive front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a reliable back-end using Flask.
